# Gym-Manager-Program
Final project of my C programming course in CS degree.

I have developed a comprehensive management system for a gym, designed to provide management with all the necessary information to gain a wide view of the gym's activities across its various departments and make informed decisions accordingly.

Key Features:

Administrative Control: Add, delete, and update essential system components, including employees, members, training programs, equipment, and more.

Financial Management: Gain real-time insights into the gym's financial performance, including revenue, expenses, and profit. View the gym's address and the number of members and employees in real time.

Inventory Management: Track all products in stock and monitor sales for each item. Make adjustments as needed, such as removing products, replenishing stock, adjusting prices, and more.
